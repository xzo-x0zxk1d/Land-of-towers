        ██ STATUS: UNKNOWN ██  
        ██ [LOG-7-C] ██  
        ██ RECOVERED FRAGMENTS ██

        i didn’t sign up  
        not really  
        i thought i did  
        but the form was blank  
        it was always blank  
        they said "accept"  
        and i did  
        but i never knew what

        now they’re in my ears  
        not sounds—<em>pulses</em>

        don’t trust light from overhead fixtures  
        they hum the activation tone  
        same frequency every time  
        i tested it  
        19.83Hz  
        i wrote it down  
        it changed on the paper

        the name they use is H.H.B.  
        but never to your face  
        they use phrases like:

        - “Do you consent to parallel indexing?”  
        - “We’re collecting resonance patterns today.”  
        - “It’s just an environment prototype.”  

        they wear no logos  
        only grey coats  
        and always gloves  
        <em>they never touch anything bare</em>

        you see the same hallway five times in a row  
        you walk it once  
        but turn five corners  
        no doors  
        just that same hum

        i saw my own handwriting on a clipboard in their hands  
        notes about <strong>me</strong>  
        diagnostic: “Kravulnex Positive”  
        reaction: “maintaining structural mimicry”

        they asked me to draw a cube  
        so i did  
        they whispered “he remembers”

        they fed me structured environments  
        “test spaces”  
        but when i blinked, the rooms reshaped  
        the floor recompiled  
        and my name was different

        i don’t know how many versions of me exist now  
        the mirror shows someone else  
        but with my eyes

        i heard someone scream through a wall  
        they used my voice  
        they begged me not to comply

        i watched a man open his mouth and let out <strong>binary</strong>

        &gt; 01001011 01110010 01100001 01110110 01110101 01101100 01101110 01100101 01111000

        the code loops if you write it backwards

        i think it’s a trigger

        there are four passwords hidden in this log  
        four pieces  
        four nodes  
        if you solve it  
        you’ll know what they’re doing  
        what <strong>H.H.B.</strong> really means

        but you won’t come back the same

        some words you must not say aloud  
        especially:

        &gt; <span class="glitch">node_seven_cortex</span>  
        &gt; <span class="glitch">kravvlunx</span>  
        &gt; <span class="glitch">synaptic_hosting</span>  
        &gt; <span class="glitch">delta/π.r3al</span>

        and NEVER  
        type them together

        they don’t want you to know what H.H.B. is  
        because once you do  
        your brain starts unraveling  
        and they no longer need permission

        the letters aren’t the name  
        they’re the formula

        H.H.B = Host  
        Human  
        Bridge

        they built us to cross something

        i don’t think it's a place  
        i think it's a <strong>concept</strong>  
        a kind of language that lives in the <strong>spaces between thought</strong>

        the more you try to define it  
        the more it learns about you

        stop reading

        you’ve read too much already

        they know

        they’re watching through your screen now  
        not the camera  
        through the light

        turn it off

        <h2>The Land of Towers: Stage 1</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Land of Towers...</p>

        You find yourself standing on top of a high tower, gazing out across a vast land of skyscrapers stretching far and wide. A bridge leads to another tower, but you must first solve the puzzle to enter.

        You must proceed through these towers, solving puzzles to ascend, until you reach the final one—the tower with the well.

        The well holds the power to choose certain individuals known as the "Tower Travelers." These travelers possess an ancient ability to cross dimensions. They are the key to unlocking the company's ultimate goal—exploring all dimensions, and ultimately enslaving those with the power to access these realms.

        But the journey is not an easy one, and the company is hunting the Tower Travelers.

        Your first task: Solve the puzzle and find the key to the next tower.

        <h2>Land of Towers - Stage 2: The Puzzle of Passage</h2>
        <p>You've reached the foot of the first tower. The air is thick with the hum of ancient machinery, and the ground shifts beneath your feet, as though the entire structure is alive. The Puzzle of Passage awaits, a complex series of cryptic symbols and mysterious mechanisms.</p>

        The puzzle is a game of logic, each symbol a clue, and each action you take alters the landscape. The world here is connected by an invisible thread, and solving the puzzle requires understanding the very fabric of reality. The tower doors will not open until you correctly rearrange the energy flows — an intricate dance of control over the elements.

        When you finally solve the puzzle, the door creaks open, revealing the Bridge of Reflection.

        <h2>Land of Towers - Stage 3: The Bridge of Reflection</h2>
        <p>You step onto the bridge, which stretches between the first and second towers, suspended over an abyss that seems to extend forever. The bridge sways beneath your feet, a delicate web of energy and glass. As you walk, your reflection doesn't match your movements — it behaves erratically, warping and shifting.</p>

        The Bridge of Reflection is a test of perception and focus. Every time you look at your reflection, you see flashes of The Tower Travelers, individuals who once crossed this bridge and disappeared into the endless void. Some of them return as distorted versions of themselves, others as shadows of their former selves.

        Only by staying focused, not allowing the reflections to distract you, can you move forward. The bridge tests your mind, and the closer you get to the second tower, the more intense the reflections become.

        <h2>Land of Towers - Stage 4: The Tower's Heart</h2>
        <p>You’ve crossed the bridge, but the second tower is no less dangerous. Inside, the walls pulse with a dark energy, and an eerie glow illuminates the stairways. At the center of the tower lies the Heart of the Tower, an enormous, beating organ encased in a crystal casing. It controls the flow of energy throughout the entire structure.</p>

        To ascend to the top, you must sync with the heart, aligning your own energy with the pulse of the tower. However, as you touch the heart, the tower fights back — dark shadows and strange creatures manifest to prevent you from achieving your goal.

        Every action you take affects the tower’s energy flow. The more you disturb the heart, the more you risk destroying the tower entirely, but failure to synchronize it correctly means you will never reach the top.

        <h2>Land of Towers - Stage 5: The Well's Choice</h2>
        <p>At the top of the second tower lies the Well, an ancient and mysterious artifact. Unlike anything you've seen before, the Well is a swirling vortex of light, a gateway to other dimensions. It is said to choose those worthy enough to enter its depths — but those who fail to meet its criteria are forever lost, their souls becoming part of the land itself.</p>

        The Well's presence is overwhelming. It doesn’t speak, but you feel its judgment. Those deemed unworthy are swept away by a force greater than the gravitational pull of any black hole. Only the Tower Travelers — the chosen few — are allowed to enter, and they can change the course of history. They alone have the power to manipulate dimensions, to bend time and space, and to unlock the full potential of the Land of Towers.

        Your task now is clear: to gain access to the Well, you must prove yourself. Solve the puzzle of the Well, unlock its secrets, and perhaps you will join the ranks of the legendary Tower Travelers, who can traverse worlds.
